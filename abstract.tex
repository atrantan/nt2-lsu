\begin{abstract}
The exponential growth of available FLOPS requires the development of 
more sophisticated programming tools enabling significantly improved 
application efficiency and scalability on current and future architectures. 
We investigate the new execution model ParalleX, 
which defines a work queue based, message driven, fine grain parallelization 
scheme based on a global address space for highly asynchronous calculations. 
This paper uses HPX, a C++ library implementing the 
ParalleX execution model, to realize the GMRES operation from
BLAS. \emph{Futures}, a mechanism of asynchrony supported by
ParalleX, are used to expose parallelism in our implementation. We examine
the performance of this new HPX GMRES code, relative to conventional parallel
GMRES implementations.
